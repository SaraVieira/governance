## Agenda

* Post-summit and OKRs
    * **Main Objective:** Reduce Frustrations of Major App Consumers
        * **Key Result:** Lower regression count
            * Regression here is defined in the same way we defined it when triaging the stabilization board
        * **Key Result:** Reduce time to discovering regressions
            * Potential questions:
                * How close, on average, are stable blockers found and fixed to beta.0?
        * **Key Result:** More comms of upcoming changes
    * next week: define measure aspect of KRs (add in Miro board)
* 10.0.0 retro?
    * Release went smoothly - no comments
* Review first wave of new 10.x.y stable issues
