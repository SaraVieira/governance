# Observers

**Administrator:** A Working Group in Electron Governance or a company represented in a Working Group wishing to introduce an Observer into their Working Group.

**Temporary worker:** A person employed or otherwise contracted by an Administrator for a temporary and fixed duration. Their role must entail that they primarily work on the Electron framework and/or other responsibilities of the Working Group they wish to join.


## Working Group Membership

Any temporary worker can can be nominated as an Observer by their Administrator for the Administrator's associated Working Group.

People acting as Observers do not have voting rights in the Working Group.

Once their contract concludes, they will lose their Observer status, but are welcome to request to join the Working Group as an independent contributor.

## Permissions

As a Working Group Observer, the worker would be granted the access that membership in that Working Group grants, but only for the duration of their contract and under the strict supervision of the Administrator.

This means they would be granted Full User access on Slack, and GitHub permissions in accordance with members of that Working Group. If their nominating party is the Chair, they would not be granted the extra permissions the Chair may have; only those of primary group members.

Observer-based access will be revoked at the end of their contract.
